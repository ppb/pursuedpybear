PursuedPyBear's Default Branch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default branch for all ppb repositories is ``canon``.

The maintainers had been discussing switching the default branch from
``master`` for multiple years. With the growing public discussion of removing
biased, racist, and discriminatory language from technical projects, we
received a request from a community member to prioritize this discussion.

We opened it up to the community to find a new name. The alternatives put
forward were ``main``, which is the name settled on by github. We also had
``trunk`` suggested to tie to the idea of the "tree" that git commits make.

The idea for ``canon`` came from a few sources. From one maintainer it was
suggested because PursuedPyBear is named after a Shakespeare reference, and
the idea of a "canon" was a silly enough connection to fit.

It was the most popular of the suggestions and thus we settled on it.
