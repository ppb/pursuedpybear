PursuedPyBear, also known as `ppb`, exists to be an educational
resource. Most obviously used to teach computer science, it can be a
useful tool for any topic that a simulation can be helpful.

## A Game Engine

At its core, `ppb` provides a number of features that make it perfect
for video games. The `GameEngine` itself provides a pluggable subsystem
architecture where adding new features is as simple as subclassing and
extending `System`. Additionally, it contains a state stack of `Scenes`
simple containers that let you organize game scenes and UI screens in a
simple way.

The entire system uses an event system which is as extensible as the
rest of the system. Register new values to existing event types, and
even overwrite the defaults. Adding a new event type to the system is as
simple as firing an instance of your new event class with `signal`.
Instead of a publisher system, the engine knows everything in its own scope
and only calls objects with appropriate callbacks. The most basic event is
`Update` and your handlers should match the signature
`on_update(self, update_event, signal)`.

## Guiding Principles

Because `ppb` started to be a game framework great for learning with,
the project has a few longterm goals:

### Education Friendly

Non-technical educators should feel comfortable after very little
training. While some programming knowledge is required, the ability to
think in objects and responses to events allows educators to only focus
on their lessons.

### Idiomatic Python

A project built on `ppb` should look like idiomatic Python. It also
should look like modern Python. As such, we often add new language
features as soon as they're available, letting a new user always know
ppb runs on the latest Python.

### Object Oriented and Event Driven

`ppb` games are built out of instances of objects. Each object only has enough
information to respond to the event provided, which always includes the current
`Scene`. Because `ppb` doesn't have a master list of events, you can
provide new ones simply to add more granular control over your game.

### Hardware Library Agnostic

Because `ppb` strongly tries to be extensible and pluggable, each
hardware extension can provide its own hooks to `ppb`, and you can
nearly seamlessly switch between various Python libraries.

### Fun

One of the maintainers put it best:

> If itâ€™s not fun to use, we should redo it

ppb is about filing off the rough edges so that the joy of creation and
discovery are both emphasized. A new user should be able to build their
first game in a few hours, and continue exploring beyond that.

## Try it

Install ppb in the standard method:

```bash
pip install ppb
```


`ppb` provides a `run` function that makes it simple to start single
screen games.

To make a very simple game, make a directory and add an image file
called `ship.png` to it. Then add the following to a python file and
run it.

```python
import ppb
from ppb.features.default_sprites import TargetSprite


class Ship(TargetSprite):
    target = ppb.Vector(0, 40)


def setup(scene):
    scene.add(Ship(position=(0, -7)))


ppb.run(setup=setup)
```

Depending on your operating system,
you may need to install additional packages
(see [installation guide](https://ppb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html#installing-ppb)).


## Compatibility

`ppb` is guaranteed compatible with Python 3.6 or later.

## Get Involved

The fastest way to get involved is to check out the [ongoing
discussions.](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiscussion)
If you're already using `ppb` feel free to report bugs, suggest
enhancements, or ask for new features.
