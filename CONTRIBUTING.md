# Get Involved

The goal of PPB is to be a learning tool. Building games can be complex, and
PPB should make that complexity approachable for new developers. It is also 
open to developers of all skill levels for contribution and improvement.

This guide will include steps experienced developers may not need explanation 
for, it's target audience is new developers not used to contribution.

## Before You Begin

1. Read the [README][readme].
2. Read the [Code of Conduct][coc].
    * All contributors must abide by the current code of conduct.
    * The current code of conduct is the [Contributor's Covenant][covenant].
3. Familiarize yourself with this guide!

## I've Never Coded Before

`ppb` doesn't include tools to get you from a proper zero to running.
Check out something like [Automate the Boring Stuff][auto] or ask a
teacher for a resource to learn with.

## I Don't Know How To Start

The best place to start is to build something with `ppb`! Joining the
community of developers who are using it and asking questions is a great
place to start. Read the tutorials written by ppb and others, and keep
notes: any time you do something that feels rough or seems to be harder
than you'd like, take a note!

## I Don't Like How This Works

After you're comfortable using `ppb` it's time to join the discussions.
We try to keep discussions public on github, and label any issue meant
to be a discussion with the [discussion label][discuss]. Your opinion
matters, and you might notice something no one else has. If you don't
like what it's like to use `ppb`, talk about it with us, and we can try
to find a solution together.

## I Found A Bug

Good news: You already know where the issue tracker is, report your bug
by adding a [new issue][issues] to the github page! Your report should
focus on the problem: What broke? What didn't work the way you expected?
How did you expect it to work?

In addition to that, we'll want to know how you got there: A link to
your code, any packages you used with ppb, and a stack trace if there is
one! Definitely remember to get the python version with `python
--version`.

Label it with the label `bug` and one of the contributors will get to it
soon!

## I Have A Suggestion

Same as with bugs, head on over to the [issue tracker][issues] and
write up an issue describing what you want to improve, and how you'd do
it.

Remember to consider the [goals and principles of ppb][goals]. We want
to leave enough for people to explore on their own, but solve enough of
the hard problems that they're free to do that.

## I Want To Code

Thanks for considering code contributions! The [new contributor label][new contributor]
is a collection of issues we believe are suitable for people new to PPB.
You are welcome to work on any issue you would like, we just think those
are a good starting place for those that are unfamiliar with the code base.

Now you need to [fork ppb][fork]. Once you've done that, go through
either column and find a ticket you like. Start a branch, add your name
to the [CONTRIBUTORS file][contributors], commit that change and open a PR:

* Include "WIP" in the title or make a [draft pull request][draftpr]
* Reference the issue you want to work on in the body of the PR.

Now get to work! Some tickets have detailed instructions: A maintainer
mapped out the needs and wrote some instructions. Others are more open.
Start working, try to solve the problem. If you get stuck, ask
questions in your open PR. The maintainers and active contributors are
here to help.

Once you think it's ready, time to remove "WIP" from the title or hit
the "Ready for review" button. Now someone senior in the project will
review. They'll either ask for changes or approve your PR. If you need
to make changes, commit to your branch and push it up and it'll update
the PR. Your reviewer will look again later.

If you got accepted, your PR will make it into the project soon! Only a
maintainer can merge your PR, so you'll need to wait. They may ask for
some final changes. Same rules as before: Push new changes to your
branch and things will be updated.

## Can I Review

You're always welcome to review other PRs! Just use the comment function
unless you're told you can block PRs. The people doing the "official"
review will take your comments into consideration. If you actively
provide reviews, you'll be told to add your name to
[CONTRIBUTORS][contributors] as a reviewer!

## I want to teach

There's a tutorial project! See the [tutorials repository's CONTRIBUTING
file][tutorial] for more details.

## Can I Contribute Without Code?

There's so much else that needs to be done besides fixing `ppb`'s code.
We need documentation. Docstrings or [the docs folder][docs] are
available to be added to. Our test suite could use some love. In the
end you contribute to `ppb` by being part of its community.
